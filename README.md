### Project Description

The goal of the project is to build a fictional encyclopedia platform about supernatural powers, where users can create, edit, search and share entries. The fictional encyclopedia is an interest-driven, creative hub for all interested users. In this application, people can work together to create and maintain a shared knowledge database for a fictional world. It is not only an encyclopedia, but also addresses the emotional and cultural needs of current young people.

### Database specifications

The database will store and manage user-contributed fictional encyclopedia entries, along with user information and edit histories. Users will be able to create new entries, request edits to existing ones, and link entries together using internal hyperlinks. The system will track contributions by different users, including original authors and additional collaborators. Users can also search and browse entries based on tags, categories and keywords. Comment systems will also be implemented, users can comment on the entries or reply to an existing comment, which will be supervised by other users and the admin will process the disciplinary report.

### Application platform

This project will use the Oracle relational database to store and manage data. For the application,  use HTML, CSS and JAVA Script for the front-end, and PHP for the back-end.
